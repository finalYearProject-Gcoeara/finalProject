B07VYRQFBJ,Maggi-Masala-Noodles-Singles-840g,2019-09-13,1,Can you use a product when it is tasted by mouse before? Even last month I received suji with same condition but nobody listening. We are promoting amazon prime to all our friends & we are receiving defective grocery. Need help,
B07VYRQFBJ,Maggi-Masala-Noodles-Singles-840g,2019-06-09,5,"Maggi is called national food of India, lol. It's tasty and non sticky and can be prepared easily and quickly. So feeling hungry? It's maggi time now.Packaging and delivery was good and prompt. The noodles were recently made so it was a fresh product. Recommend to every age group as a quick snack.",

It's iconic for anyone born in the 80s and 90s.Review of this pack:1) better than large packs that you have to store in the open2) Lasts longer than regular pack of eight, again because its closed.Disadvantage :More plastic usage than regular pack or tenConclusion:If you are going to consume Maggi over longer period of time but this one, if you will finish pack of ten within a week buy the regular large packs as it saves plastic pollution--",

Broken during delivery or not, doesnt really matter to me, since I prefer to break them into 2 pieces anyways before I cook them2. This family big pack really is cost effective.3. Nestle maggi has been around for so many decades from my childhood and they have been consistent and have even braved the recent questions raised on the quality of their product!4. Masala taste is ever so tasty5. Cooks really fast...ok not 2, let's say 5mins!Cons-1. Though maggi comes with atta noodles (healthier) than this maggi, the atta maggi is quiet expensive than this normal maggi. How I wish the oats and atta maggi would have been cheaper too",

B07VYRQFBJ,Maggi-Masala-Noodles-Singles-840g,2019-01-16,1,The product is expired or something is very wrong with these Maggie.... Got stomach problems after eating them... They smell different and the best part is we cannot even return them,
B07VYRQFBJ,Maggi-Masala-Noodles-Singles-840g,2017-11-29,1,This product was supplied in damaged condition.The package is damaged and full of ants inside.Also the app states this product do not qualify for return.,
B07VYRQFBJ,Maggi-Masala-Noodles-Singles-840g,2019-09-13,1,Can you use a product when it is tasted by mouse before? Even last month I received suji with same condition but nobody listening. We are promoting amazon prime to all our friends & we are receiving defective grocery. Need help,
B07VYRQFBJ,Maggi-Masala-Noodles-Singles-840g,2019-06-09,5,"Maggi is called national food of India, lol. It's tasty and non sticky and can be prepared easily and quickly. So feeling hungry? It's maggi time now.Packaging and delivery was good and prompt. The noodles were recently made so it was a fresh product. Recommend to every age group as a quick snack.",
B07VYRQFBJ,Maggi-Masala-Noodles-Singles-840g,2019-05-30,5,"Review of maggi:Who am I to review Maggi. It's iconic for anyone born in the 80s and 90s.Review of this pack:1) better than large packs that you have to store in the open2) Lasts longer than regular pack of eight, again because its closed.Disadvantage :More plastic usage than regular pack or tenConclusion:If you are going to consume Maggi over longer period of time but this one, if you will finish pack of ten within a week buy the regular large packs as it saves plastic pollution--",
B07VYRQFBJ,Maggi-Masala-Noodles-Singles-840g,2018-03-15,1,"Seems damaged pack delivered with ants inside. Not one or two, thousands of them . Ants spread in whole kitchen now.",
B07VYRQFBJ,Maggi-Masala-Noodles-Singles-840g,2018-10-11,5,"I just love the 2 minute noodle !Pros-1. Broken during delivery or not, doesnt really matter to me, since I prefer to break them into 2 pieces anyways before I cook them2. This family big pack really is cost effective.3. Nestle maggi has been around for so many decades from my childhood and they have been consistent and have even braved the recent questions raised on the quality of their product!4. Masala taste is ever so tasty5. Cooks really fast...ok not 2, let's say 5mins!Cons-1. Though maggi comes with atta noodles (healthier) than this maggi, the atta maggi is quiet expensive than this normal maggi. How I wish the oats and atta maggi would have been cheaper too",

B078KT9RB1,Amul-Cacao-Chocolate-125g-Pack,2020-01-01,5,"Chocolate didn't melt in transit to Bhubaneswar( doesn't melt in transit to Bengaluru either).I love dark chocolate and can eat comfortably till Amul 90%, so wanted to try the ultimate 99% but found it a little too bitter for my taste so now I use it to make hot chocolate and it tastes much better than Hershey's. Just chop this chocolate into small pieces and stir it in your milk!",

If i was a terrorist i would speak out everything after eating this in return of sugar..Jokes apart guys this is best and cheapest you can get, well done,  amul really the taste of india ❤❤❤",
B078KT9RB1,Amul-Cacao-Chocolate-125g-Pack,2020-01-24,5,"It's DARK AND BITTER, so if you're one of those sweet suger filled fake chocolate lovers, than this is out of your league, stick to your sugar candies.It's extremely hard to find anything this dark in India and even if there are, they're extremely pricy cause of low quantity production. Thanks to AMUL, now we have true dark chocolate at affordable price.NB: Loving the texture and feel of the chocolate. I'm really happy.Update: Finished 4 packs in less than 13 days. Ordered another 4. I just love the texture of the chocolate in my mouth. Truly in love ❤️",
B078KT9RB1,Amul-Cacao-Chocolate-125g-Pack,2020-01-30,5,It's literally heavenly feeling to taste this chocolate. The chocolate is bitter to the core. It has no added suger. Sugery chocolate/fake chocolate lovers won't like it. It's for those people who has developed taste for cocoa/cacao over the period of time. It's made for chocolate connoisseur. Price is very less when compare to other brands in market. Plus Amul is well-known brand itself. Packaging was nice.,
B078KT9RB1,Amul-Cacao-Chocolate-125g-Pack,2020-06-26,5,"I simply love this pure cocoa taste....not sure if people consider this bitter, I personally do not feel so, may be very mildly. But the cocoa taste, flavor indeed feels great.I had earlier tasted upto 90% dark among the Amul chocolates (& of course couple of other makes including Lindt). In fact I have graduated in darkness with Amul's progression in a way starting at 55% then 75, 90 and now 99% - in fact love the whole range by Amul. As long as this range is available I will never have to look beyond for Dark chocolates. Thanks Amul. In fact on an earlier occasion I had purchased 99% dark of some other make and did not like the flavor at all - strangely it had kind of a sourish smell and so far a bit hesitant with this item as well at first.Another thing the chocolates were delivered superbly packaged - thanks to the seller. Had a carton box outside and inside of it the chocolate packs had a layer of some kind of gel filled plastic bags to keep the chocolates at non melting temperature....pretty cool - so no melting problem or anything for me.So this would be my daily dose of dark chocolate from now on like a cube (or sometimes two) after each meal - enjoyable in taste, and so sugar, no guilt!!",
B078KT9RB1,Amul-Cacao-Chocolate-125g-Pack,2020-01-28,4,"So basically, this is not the chocolate for everyone. At first when I tasted it, I badly regretted buying it. It tasted nowhere near the chocolate you would find in the market. There isn't even the slightest hint of any kind of sweetness in it and most people would find it gross. But the more I ate it, the more I could feel it's richness and realised how decadent it is. It's not a chocolate, it's THE chocolate.",
B078KT9RB1,Amul-Cacao-Chocolate-125g-Pack,2020-01-25,5,"Amul 99% cacao is the best dark/bitter chocolate available in India... excellent innovation by Amul. I may tell that I am not endorsing Amul or any other brand...just my own opinions. It has been proven that cacao is one of the healthiest superfoods on earth with amazing health benefits. It's full of antioxidants & flavonoids which increase lifespan. It's one of the highest sources of nitric oxide which dilates/widens & relaxes blood vessels of the body by reducing blockages, thereby supporting heart & brain health. Cacao is also anti inflammatory and anti carcinogenic, thus reduces cancer risk. Moreover, cacao is a natural blood thinner, so can prevent blood clots, reduce blood cholesterol & blood sugar and lower blood pressure. Overall Amul dark cacao chocolate has enormous health benefits...so we must be thankful to Amul for making such an awesome health food. Please ignore the negative and one star rated reviews as those people are ignorant and lack awareness. Requesting all the sugar lovers...please don't defame such a nice and healthy product by giving negative ratings and one star. I pity those innocent sweet toothed people which focus on tongue taste rather than general health. Again, I am not promoting Amul company or a representative of the same, these are my personal views & experience. Those who want to enhance quality of life and reduce onset of lifestyle/genetic diseases like cancer, diabetes, hypertension, stroke, heart attacks, cardiac arrest, etc must not think twice...just purchase the stuff & enjoy. Infact, Amul 99% Cacao Chocolate is a heavenly bliss with irresistible taste. It is indeed Delightful & Ambrosial. I am giving a five star rating to this authentic product...if there were 10 stars, I would have given full 10/10. Lastly, thanks to Amul & Amazon, too for providing such a nice superfood at my doorstep.",

B078KT9RB1,Amul-Cacao-Chocolate-125g-Pack,2020-01-04,5,All the chocolate lovers will love this chocolate! (P.S. I said chocolate lovers not sugar lovers.). It's absolutely one of the best dark chocolates in India. You can go for it only if you are a die hard fan of cocoa! Order delivered was absolutely fresh and was in the finest state.,
B078KT9RB1,Amul-Cacao-Chocolate-125g-Pack,2020-01-01,5,"Chocolate didn't melt in transit to Bhubaneswar( doesn't melt in transit to Bengaluru either).I love dark chocolate and can eat comfortably till Amul 90%, so wanted to try the ultimate 99% but found it a little too bitter for my taste so now I use it to make hot chocolate and it tastes much better than Hershey's. Just chop this chocolate into small pieces and stir it in your milk!",
B078KT9RB1,Amul-Cacao-Chocolate-125g-Pack,2020-07-09,5,"Bitter is a very silple word, need some terrible word to describe this, i don't think i can go beyond 70% cocao... now i don't know what i will do with two bars.... on a lighter note: guys think twice before ordering, this is some 3rd degree torture not for general public use, might help military to torture terrorists. If i was a terrorist i would speak out everything after eating this in return of sugar..Jokes apart guys this is best and cheapest you can get, well done,  amul really the taste of india ❤❤❤",
B078KT9RB1,Amul-Cacao-Chocolate-125g-Pack,2020-01-24,5,"It's DARK AND BITTER, so if you're one of those sweet suger filled fake chocolate lovers, than this is out of your league, stick to your sugar candies.It's extremely hard to find anything this dark in India and even if there are, they're extremely pricy cause of low quantity production. Thanks to AMUL, now we have true dark chocolate at affordable price.NB: Loving the texture and feel of the chocolate. I'm really happy.Update: Finished 4 packs in less than 13 days. Ordered another 4. I just love the texture of the chocolate in my mouth. Truly in love ❤️",
B078KT9RB1,Amul-Cacao-Chocolate-125g-Pack,2020-01-30,5,It's literally heavenly feeling to taste this chocolate. The chocolate is bitter to the core. It has no added suger. Sugery chocolate/fake chocolate lovers won't like it. It's for those people who has developed taste for cocoa/cacao over the period of time. It's made for chocolate connoisseur. Price is very less when compare to other brands in market. Plus Amul is well-known brand itself. Packaging was nice.,
B078KT9RB1,Amul-Cacao-Chocolate-125g-Pack,2020-06-26,5,"I simply love this pure cocoa taste....not sure if people consider this bitter, I personally do not feel so, may be very mildly. But the cocoa taste, flavor indeed feels great.I had earlier tasted upto 90% dark among the Amul chocolates (& of course couple of other makes including Lindt). In fact I have graduated in darkness with Amul's progression in a way starting at 55% then 75, 90 and now 99% - in fact love the whole range by Amul. As long as this range is available I will never have to look beyond for Dark chocolates. Thanks Amul. In fact on an earlier occasion I had purchased 99% dark of some other make and did not like the flavor at all - strangely it had kind of a sourish smell and so far a bit hesitant with this item as well at first.Another thing the chocolates were delivered superbly packaged - thanks to the seller. Had a carton box outside and inside of it the chocolate packs had a layer of some kind of gel filled plastic bags to keep the chocolates at non melting temperature....pretty cool - so no melting problem or anything for me.So this would be my daily dose of dark chocolate from now on like a cube (or sometimes two) after each meal - enjoyable in taste, and so sugar, no guilt!!",
B078KT9RB1,Amul-Cacao-Chocolate-125g-Pack,2020-01-28,4,"So basically, this is not the chocolate for everyone. At first when I tasted it, I badly regretted buying it. It tasted nowhere near the chocolate you would find in the market. There isn't even the slightest hint of any kind of sweetness in it and most people would find it gross. But the more I ate it, the more I could feel it's richness and realised how decadent it is. It's not a chocolate, it's THE chocolate.",
B078KT9RB1,Amul-Cacao-Chocolate-125g-Pack,2020-01-25,5,"Amul 99% cacao is the best dark/bitter chocolate available in India... excellent innovation by Amul. I may tell that I am not endorsing Amul or any other brand...just my own opinions. It has been proven that cacao is one of the healthiest superfoods on earth with amazing health benefits. It's full of antioxidants & flavonoids which increase lifespan. It's one of the highest sources of nitric oxide which dilates/widens & relaxes blood vessels of the body by reducing blockages, thereby supporting heart & brain health. Cacao is also anti inflammatory and anti carcinogenic, thus reduces cancer risk. Moreover, cacao is a natural blood thinner, so can prevent blood clots, reduce blood cholesterol & blood sugar and lower blood pressure. Overall Amul dark cacao chocolate has enormous health benefits...so we must be thankful to Amul for making such an awesome health food. Please ignore the negative and one star rated reviews as those people are ignorant and lack awareness. Requesting all the sugar lovers...please don't defame such a nice and healthy product by giving negative ratings and one star.

B00WMNXH7Q,Society-Tea-Regular-Pouch-1kg,2019-05-20,5,"I'm a milk-tea addicted person. Although, I control it upto thrice day but sometimes it may exceed 5.Since I like milk-tea alot, I have tried many Dust-teas available in the market.I've tried and tasted Wagh-bakri, brookebond, Taj, society, maharsthra chai, maa-beti Chai & you name it.I liked the society tea alot. This tea when boiled in the water gives a nice flavor and the color which no other teas can give.The packaging was nice. I ordered for a 1kg pack directly since I already knew about the taste.From the value for money standpoint, it is a little costlier (20-30 Rs per kg)  in comparison to its other teas of its class. But you will find it worth it. Just make sure you use a correct method to prepare to get the best out of it.Method in the sense, first boil it in water and then add milk.Directly adding into milk will also give you the good taste but the colour will fade away in that case.",

Not a percent less.Price was also similar to Tata tea gold. Henceforth we are going to buy whichever brand is on discount online.,

Although, I control it upto thrice day but sometimes it may exceed 5.Since I like milk-tea alot, I have tried many Dust-teas available in the market.I've tried and tasted Wagh-bakri, brookebond, Taj, society, maharsthra chai, maa-beti Chai & you name it.I liked the society tea alot. This tea when boiled in the water gives a nice flavor and the color which no other teas can give.The packaging was nice. I ordered for a 1kg pack directly since I already knew about the taste.From the value for money standpoint, it is a little costlier (20-30 Rs per kg)  in comparison to its other teas of its class. But you will find it worth it. Just make sure you use a correct method to prepare to get the best out of it.Method in the sense, first boil it in water and then add milk.Directly adding into milk will also give you the good taste but the colour will fade away in that case.",

B00WMNXH7Q,Society-Tea-Regular-Pouch-1kg,2020-07-17,5,We are A family of tea drinkers and found it to be the best ever had.Been faithful to Tata tea gold since it got launched but had to buy society tea when our brand was not available during lockdown and found it to be better than Tata tea gold.Where Tata tea gold has longer leaf this one looks like any other tea but once the tea is brewed the colour and taste was as strong as Tata tea gold. Not a percent less.Price was also similar to Tata tea gold. Henceforth we are going to buy whichever brand is on discount online.,
B00WMNXH7Q,Society-Tea-Regular-Pouch-1kg,2019-11-13,3,"Tea above rs. 400 per kg should not contain dust..At the rate 400/-, why to add dust with ctc granules.. Its a 100% margin business, still the company providing sub standard ctc instead of bopsm.. I will not going yo buy it again",
B00WMNXH7Q,Society-Tea-Regular-Pouch-1kg,2019-10-11,4,"Society tea by far is the best brand in terms of taste, colour and flavour. I'm using this brand of tea since ages, maybe more than 15 years.

Also the tea leaves had some foul chemical odour coming, usually teas leaves give a fine frangance.This was prepared with full milk and not black. Not buying this again for sure.",
B017ICN80G,Society-Tea-Premium-Packet-1000g,2019-10-10,5,Great taste. Bought it for my parents as they prefer mild teas and it is great for both mild and strong teas. We add a bit more leaves to make it strong. Most teas in Kerala have a flowery taste and they are not good for masala chai. This purchase solved that issue. It's great as a black tea as well. Just don't boil it while making black tea. Boil the leaves only for masala chai.,

B017ICN80G,Society-Tea-Premium-Packet-1000g,2018-09-01,5,Strong tea. I prefer it this way.,
B017ICN80G,Society-Tea-Premium-Packet-1000g,2019-02-27,2,The original society tea the blue packet is better than this. It has one salty taste that make the tea horrible. No premium quality. Price has increased with deteriorated quality,
B017ICN80G,Society-Tea-Premium-Packet-1000g,2018-12-13,4,"The tea is really good. Tastes better than wagh bakri premium tea but grain size is much smaller.Leaves a lot of dust at the bottom of the container which is a bit annoying. Every time you finish the container, a lot of tea will be wasted in the form of dust.",
B017ICN80G,Society-Tea-Premium-Packet-1000g,2018-12-08,4,We are drinking this tea since years when we are in Mumbai.Only recently started to purchase it on amazon as it is'nt available in any stores across Hyderabad.But in few packets the tea is very tiny n does not taste as strong as it should be.,
B017ICN80G,Society-Tea-Premium-Packet-1000g,2020-01-16,3,"As the pricing was highest for this product in the company range assumed that it would be the best color and flavor.However was disspointed as the flavor is similar to the cheaper leaf tea or even some good dust variety. Also the tea leaves had some foul chemical odour coming, usually teas leaves give a fine frangance.This was prepared with full milk and not black. Not buying this again for sure.",
B017ICN80G,Society-Tea-Premium-Packet-1000g,2019-10-10,5,Great taste. Bought it for my parents as they prefer mild teas and it is great for both mild and strong teas. We add a bit more leaves to make it strong. Most teas in Kerala have a flowery taste and they are not good for masala chai. This purchase solved that issue. It's great as a black tea as well. Just don't boil it while making black tea. Boil the leaves only for masala chai.,
B017ICN80G,Society-Tea-Premium-Packet-1000g,2020-05-11,3,"Good strong flavour, low price. But falsely advertised as ""premium Leaf"". It is very granular, almost like coffee grounds.Grains smaller than standard CTC, something like Dust Tea.",
B017ICN80G,Society-Tea-Premium-Packet-1000g,2019-03-24,5,"Very good taste. Feel the rich aroma. Very refreshing. After tasting several brands, found this tea with the premium flavor I was looking for. I will buy only this Society Premium tea moving forward.",

B00GLDPBJK,Tata-Tea-Gold-500g,2018-10-20,3,I have been using this product for more than three years but I always purchased 500 gm and 250 gm pack but this is the first time that I have purchased 1 kg pack with the expectation that the quality would be same but alas! this 1 kg pack has too much dust tea and very less leaf tea compared to 500 gm or 250 gm pack.Regarding price it is competitive than market price and regarding delivery I would give amazon one star.,
B00GLDPBJK,Tata-Tea-Gold-500g,2017-09-06,5,Got it on deal arnd @190 rs.,
B00GLDPBJK,Tata-Tea-Gold-500g,2019-06-23,4,"Reviewing CTC tea can be tricky: everyone has their own preferences. Flavour profiles that one has become accustomed to often determines how one reacts to a new tea.For the purpose of making milk tea,  this particular brand is quite good: a strong combination of good colour, definitely pleasing fragrance and taste that's firm but not too overpowering.This is a good option for someone used to tee leaves made by the likes of Wagh Bakri. This has slightly more liquor to it than the Wagh Bakhri and the fragrance spectrum is a bit wider.If you're the type who likes your Tata Agni and similar robust and bolder tea leaves then this may not be what you're looking for.It's price point is on the higher side and may be a factor for many. That said,  if you enjoy that one good cup a day,  it's a worthy buy-in.My recommendation: certainly worth a try especially if you like a good,  developed flavour in your cuppa.",

B089638Q8J,Tata-Tea-Gold-1kg,2017-07-09,5,"If you really a teas fan, you definitely not being unaware of the TATA Tea family. Trusted brand from so many years. I tried almost every standard brand of Teas available in the market, but at last I can say that TATA Tea is the best available brand in the printed price. Although TATA Tea brand is already quite efficient in serving the purpose but the current addition of 'TATA Tea Gold' actually makes sense because of the quality enhancement by adding dried whole tea leaves in to the processed tea. Mixing of whole leaf resulted into the enhanced flavor & color of the prepared Tea. Not more concentrated not milder, it’s like a balanced golden color with real taste/flavor which designed exactly keeping in mind the expectation of the user.1. I agree that if you require strong color/flavor you need to add a little more leaves in to the preparation because TATA Tea Gold is not meant for people who like very strong color seekers. Its more workable for people who wants real flavor with natural golden color in the final preparation. Although even a single tea-spoon is enough to prepare a natural golden cup full of real tea.2. One may keep in mind before using that this tea contains real whole dry tea leaves, so it may take more 2 minutes in preparation in comparison with other brands and the reason is, it is without any added artificial colors into it. The whole dried tea leaves takes time to release real flavor of the contents.3. Taste is premium & up to the expectations as always.4. Packaging is good enough. Visual ergonomic principles well taken into consideration designing the same. Its smarter and visually appealing than the previous packs.I’m using this product from more than 2 years.

B089638Q8J,Tata-Tea-Gold-1kg,2017-08-10,5,"I prefer Tata tea to Brooke Bond/Taj Mahal.# Mild taste and fresh aroma# Gives me a soothing effect and relishes# Only small quantity sufficient for making tea# Does not play around with the basic tea taste# Can be consumed with milk or without itThe only issue is with the packaging, I would have preferred plastic box packaging for the price.That would actually help in preserving the aroma and prevent moisture.But, it's one of the best tea for everyday use.Cheers :)",

This it is very useful for daily use...I got this product from Amazon and got a recently manufactured product... The product is a genuine product...There are other variety of Tea available in the market but among those Tata gold tea is is the best tea according to me for daily use...I got the product at 15% discounted price, as I bought the product during Super Value Days.The manufacturing date of product was just 2 and half months ago from date when I received the product in hand. Hence it is recently manufactured product. Also the product have a very good shelf life.Amazon delivered the product in very good condition and packaging of the product was just awesome. No damage. Amazing...The Amazon pantry box are very hard and during packaging they insert air filled sealed packets, so that the items don't move and pressure is absorbed by the air filled packets.Delivery of my order was just the next day morning. The delivery man took the package inside of my house, as it was heavy and kept the pantry box over a table, as I told him. I behavior of the delivery man was good.I am highly satisfied with the product and I recommend you to buy the product without any fear and hesitation. Believe me you will be satisfied after receiving the product and using it.",
B089638Q8J,Tata-Tea-Gold-1kg,2019-03-03,5,"After using Taj Mahal tea for 20 years, now since the quality of Taj Mahal tea has gone down tremendously, and we have gas and stomach problems after consuming taj mahal tea, we wanted to shift for a better tea. After finding out a lot about different brands, I can assure you This is best tea in India. Always buy this.The taste is awesome, the only drawback is you have to put a lot of tea if you're used to drinking strong tea. Otherwise this is awesome.",
B089638Q8J,Tata-Tea-Gold-1kg,2019-08-05,1,"Once you see the packing and presentation of the package, one gets positive vibes and expects a lot more than regular tea. ALAS! It is much the same as Agni. Nothing more. Have to use good quantity to prepare good tea.",

B089638Q8J,Tata-Tea-Gold-1kg,2018-12-21,5,I have been taking Tata Gold tea since over two decades now. I have tried many cheap and expensive products but Tata Gold is non-replaceable. The new golden color packing is attractive.,

B08CHMZD9K,Tata-Tea-Gold-Leaf-Pouch,2020-07-26,4,The taste is good and one will enjoy. The name GOLD is only superlative. Actual taste is just above average. Tata Tea Gold fails in giving rich brown colour to tea. Hence it does not meet 100% expectation.,
